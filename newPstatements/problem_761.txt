Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even. Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even. Return any answer array that satisfies this condition. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [4,2,5,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [4,5,2,7] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,3] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104 nums.length is even. Half of the integers in nums are even. 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000 Follow Up:</h4> Could you solve it in-place?
