Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. A happy number is a number defined by the following process:</h4> Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 19 <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 12 + 92 = 82 82 + 22 = 68 62 + 82 = 100 12 + 02 + 02 = 1 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
