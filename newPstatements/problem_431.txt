Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1. An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other. A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = "aba", b = "cdc" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc". Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = "aaa", b = "bbb" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb". <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = "aaa", b = "aaa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100 a and b consist of lower-case English letters.
