Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of \'L\' and \'R\' characters. Given a balanced string s, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings. Return the maximum amount of split balanced strings. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "RLRRLLRLRL" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of \'L\' and \'R\'. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "RLLLLRRRLR" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of \'L\' and \'R\'. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "LLLLRRRR" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> s can be split into "LLLLRRRR". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s[i] is either \'L\' or \'R\'. s is a balanced string.
