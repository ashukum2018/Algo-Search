You are given a string s containing lowercase letters and an integer k. You need to :</h4> First, change some characters of s to other lowercase English letters. Then divide s into k non-empty disjoint substrings such that each substring is a palindrome. Return the minimal number of characters that you need to change to divide the string. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abc", k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You can split the string into "ab" and "c", and change 1 character in "ab" to make it palindrome. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aabbc", k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You can split the string into "aa", "bb" and "c", all of them are palindrome. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "leetcode", k = 8 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= k <= s.length <= 100. s only contains lowercase English letters.
