Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,3,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100
