Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation). Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = 2, b = 6, c = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c) <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = 4, b = 2, c = 7 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= a <= 10^9 1 <= b <= 10^9 1 <= c <= 10^9
