There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n. You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range. Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [10,55,45,25,25] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Flight labels:</h4> 1 2 3 4 5 Booking 1 reserved:</h4> 10 10 Booking 2 reserved:</h4> 20 20 Booking 3 reserved:</h4> 25 25 25 25 Total seats:</h4> 10 55 45 25 25 Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [10,25] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Flight labels:</h4> 1 2 Booking 1 reserved:</h4> 10 10 Booking 2 reserved:</h4> 15 Total seats:</h4> 10 25 Hence, answer = [10,25] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 2 * 104 1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 104 bookings[i].length == 3 1 <= firsti <= lasti <= n 1 <= seatsi <= 104
