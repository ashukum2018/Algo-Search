Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. The interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d. Return the number of remaining intervals. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000 intervals[i].length == 2 0 <= li < ri <= 105 All the given intervals are unique.
