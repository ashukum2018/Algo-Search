There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network. A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server. Return all critical connections in the network in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,3]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [[3,1]] is also accepted. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, connections = [[0,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[0,1]] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= n <= 105 n - 1 <= connections.length <= 105 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1 ai != bi There are no repeated connections.
