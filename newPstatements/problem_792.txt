In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters. Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> As \'h\' comes before \'l\' in this language, then the sequence is sorted. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> As \'d\' comes after \'l\' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because \'l\' > \'\xe2\x88\x85\', where \'\xe2\x88\x85\' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= words.length <= 100 1 <= words[i].length <= 20 order.length == 26 All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.
