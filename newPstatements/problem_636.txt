Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s. A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position. For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcde", goal = "abced" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100 s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.
