Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [24,12,8,6] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,0,9,0,0] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= nums.length <= 105 -30 <= nums[i] <= 30 The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. Follow up:</h4> Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
