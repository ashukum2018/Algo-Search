Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node. You can return the answer in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [7,4,1] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5) have values 7, 4, and 1. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1], target = 1, k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 500]. 0 <= Node.val <= 500 All the values Node.val are unique. target is the value of one of the nodes in the tree. 0 <= k <= 1000
