Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space. Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "the sky is blue" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "blue is sky the" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = " hello world " <br><h4>Output:</h4> "world hello" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "a good example" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "example good a" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 104 s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces \' \'. There is at least one word in s. Follow-up:</h4> If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
