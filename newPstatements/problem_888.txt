A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line. You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed). Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i]. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> heights:</h4> [1,1,4,2,1,3] expected:</h4> [1,1,1,2,3,4] Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> heights = [5,1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> heights:</h4> [5,1,2,3,4] expected:</h4> [1,2,3,4,5] All indices do not match. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> heights = [1,2,3,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> heights:</h4> [1,2,3,4,5] expected:</h4> [1,2,3,4,5] All indices match. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= heights.length <= 100 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
