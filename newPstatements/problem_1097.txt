Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order. A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [15] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [12] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [7] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == mat.length n == mat[i].length 1 <= n, m <= 50 1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105. All elements in the matrix are distinct.
