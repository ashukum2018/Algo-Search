Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit, return the size of the longest non-empty subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to limit. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> All subarrays are:</h4> [8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4. [8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. [8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. [8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. [2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4. [2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4. [2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4. [4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4. [4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4. [7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 105 1 <= nums[i] <= 109 0 <= limit <= 109
