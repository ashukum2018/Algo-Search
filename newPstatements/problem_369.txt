Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [5,6] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == nums.length 1 <= n <= 105 1 <= nums[i] <= n Follow up:</h4> Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
