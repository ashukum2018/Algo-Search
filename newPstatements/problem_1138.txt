Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, nums[i] and nums[j], where i < j, the condition j - i <= k is satisfied. A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [10,2,-10,5,20], k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 37 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subsequence is [10, 2, 5, 20]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [-1,-2,-3], k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subsequence must be non-empty, so we choose the largest number. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [10,-2,-10,-5,20], k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 23 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subsequence is [10, -2, -5, 20]. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
