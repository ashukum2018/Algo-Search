You are given an array of strings arr. A string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of arr that has unique characters. Return the maximum possible length of s. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr = ["un","iq","ue"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> All the valid concatenations are:</h4> - "" - "un" - "iq" - "ue" - "uniq" ("un" + "iq") - "ique" ("iq" + "ue") Maximum length is 4. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Possible longest valid concatenations are "chaers" ("cha" + "ers") and "acters" ("act" + "ers"). <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 26 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only string in arr has all 26 characters. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= arr.length <= 16 1 <= arr[i].length <= 26 arr[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
