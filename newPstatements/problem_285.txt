The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root. Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night. Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 9 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. 0 <= Node.val <= 104
