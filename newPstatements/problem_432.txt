Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1. An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others. A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= strs.length <= 50 1 <= strs[i].length <= 10 strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
