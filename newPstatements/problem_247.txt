Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 12 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 12 = 4 + 4 + 4. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 13 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 13 = 4 + 9. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 104
