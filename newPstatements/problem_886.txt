You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone. We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:</h4> If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x. At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left. Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then, we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then, we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then, we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> stones = [31,26,33,21,40] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= stones.length <= 30 1 <= stones[i] <= 100
