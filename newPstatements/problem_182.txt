Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> rotate 1 steps to the right:</h4> [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] rotate 2 steps to the right:</h4> [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] rotate 3 steps to the right:</h4> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [3,99,-1,-100] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> rotate 1 steps to the right:</h4> [99,-1,-100,3] rotate 2 steps to the right:</h4> [3,99,-1,-100] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 105 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1 0 <= k <= 105 Follow up:</h4> Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
