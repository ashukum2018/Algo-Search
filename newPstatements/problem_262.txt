An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence. A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two. Given a string containing only digits, return true if it is an additive number or false otherwise. Note:</h4> Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> "112358" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The digits can form an additive sequence:</h4> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> "199100199" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The additive sequence is:</h4> 1, 99, 100, 199. 1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= num.length <= 35 num consists only of digits.
