There are n soldiers standing in a line. Each soldier is assigned a unique rating value. You have to form a team of 3 soldiers amongst them under the following rules:</h4> Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]). A team is valid if:</h4> (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n). Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. (soldiers can be part of multiple teams). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> rating = [2,5,3,4,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We can form three teams given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> rating = [2,1,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We can't form any team given the conditions. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> rating = [1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == rating.length 3 <= n <= 1000 1 <= rating[i] <= 105 All the integers in rating are unique.
