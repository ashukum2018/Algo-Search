You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters. You can return the answer in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,9] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively. The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [6,9,12] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 104 s consists of lower-case English letters. 1 <= words.length <= 5000 1 <= words[i].length <= 30 words[i] consists of lower-case English letters.
