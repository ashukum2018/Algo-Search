Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false. Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j]. For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad". <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ab", goal = "ba" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You can swap s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'b\' to get "ba", which is equal to goal. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ab", goal = "ab" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only letters you can swap are s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'b\', which results in "ba" != goal. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aa", goal = "aa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You can swap s[0] = \'a\' and s[1] = \'a\' to get "aa", which is equal to goal. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104 s and goal consist of lowercase letters.
