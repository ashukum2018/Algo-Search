Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100 Follow up:</h4> Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
