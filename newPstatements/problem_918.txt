Suppose you are given the following code:</h4> class FooBar { public void foo() { for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { print("foo"); } } public void bar() { for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { print("bar"); } } } The same instance of FooBar will be passed to two different threads:</h4> thread A will call foo(), while thread B will call bar(). Modify the given program to output "foobar" n times. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "foobar" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are two threads being fired asynchronously. One of them calls foo(), while the other calls bar(). "foobar" is being output 1 time. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "foobarfoobar" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "foobar" is being output 2 times. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000
