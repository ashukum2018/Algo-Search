We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in the 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10. For example, for n = 3, the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the 3rd row is 0110. Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1, k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> row 1:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> row 1:</h4> 0 row 2:</h4> 01 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> row 1:</h4> 0 row 2:</h4> 01 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 30 1 <= k <= 2n - 1
