Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. Return the answer in an array. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [8,1,2,2,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [4,0,1,1,3] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it. For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [6,5,4,8] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,1,0,3] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [7,7,7,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,0,0,0] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= nums.length <= 500 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
