Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. \'#\' means a backspace character. Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Both s and t become "ac". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ab##", t = "c#d#" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Both s and t become "". <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "a#c", t = "b" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> s becomes "c" while t becomes "b". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200 s and t only contain lowercase letters and \'#\' characters. Follow up:</h4> Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
