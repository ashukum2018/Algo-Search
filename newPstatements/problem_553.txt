You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island. Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 50 grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
