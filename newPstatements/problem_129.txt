Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 9 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= nums.length <= 105 -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
