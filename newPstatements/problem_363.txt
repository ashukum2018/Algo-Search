You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete. Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 8 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
