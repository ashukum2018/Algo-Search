Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. Initially, there is a number n on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:</h4> Choosing any x with 0 < x < n and n % x == 0. Replacing the number n on the chalkboard with n - x. Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game. Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000
