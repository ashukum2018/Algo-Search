You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms:</h4> "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names. Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> equations = ["a==b","b!=a"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second. There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> equations = ["b==a","a==b"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= equations.length <= 500 equations[i].length == 4 equations[i][0] is a lowercase letter. equations[i][1] is either \'=\' or \'!\'. equations[i][2] is \'=\'. equations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.
