An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:</h4> \'A\':</h4> Absent. \'L\':</h4> Late. \'P\':</h4> Present. Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:</h4> The student was absent (\'A\') for strictly fewer than 2 days total. The student was never late (\'L\') for 3 or more consecutive days. Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 109 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 8 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are 8 records with length 2 that are eligible for an award:</h4> "PP", "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL" Only "AA" is not eligible because there are 2 absences (there need to be fewer than 2). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 10101 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 183236316 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 105
