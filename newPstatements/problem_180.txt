The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as \'A\', \'C\', \'G\', and \'T\'. For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence. When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA. Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT" <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA" <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["AAAAAAAAAA"] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 s[i] is either \'A\', \'C\', \'G\', or \'T\'.
