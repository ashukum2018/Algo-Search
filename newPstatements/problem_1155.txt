Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime. The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i]. Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We have 3 students where:</h4> The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4. The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4. The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> startTime.length == endTime.length 1 <= startTime.length <= 100 1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000 1 <= queryTime <= 1000
