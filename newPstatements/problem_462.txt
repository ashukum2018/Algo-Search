Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one. The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = "123" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "121" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = "1" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "0" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n.length <= 18 n consists of only digits. n does not have leading zeros. n is representing an integer in the range [1, 1018 - 1].
