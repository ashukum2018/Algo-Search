Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string. You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num1 = "11", num2 = "123" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "134" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num1 = "456", num2 = "77" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "533" <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num1 = "0", num2 = "0" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "0" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104 num1 and num2 consist of only digits. num1 and num2 don\'t have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
