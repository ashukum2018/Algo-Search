Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree. In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,3,4,5,6] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100]. 1 <= Node.val <= 1000
