There is a set of n items. You are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit. Choose a subset s of the n elements such that:</h4> The size of the subset s is less than or equal to numWanted. There are at most useLimit items with the same label in s. The score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset. Return the maximum score of a subset s. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 9 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 12 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 16 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The subset chosen is the first and fourth items. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == values.length == labels.length 1 <= n <= 2 * 104 0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 104 1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n
