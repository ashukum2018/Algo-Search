You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character. Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s. An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "bab", t = "aba" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Replace the first \'a\' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "leetcode", t = "practice" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Replace \'p\', \'r\', \'a\', \'i\' and \'c\' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "anagram", t = "mangaar" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 s.length == t.length s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.
