Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,2,5] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [1,1,1,2,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,3] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100 The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
