Given two integers tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:</h4> Jumbo Burger:</h4> 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice. Small Burger:</h4> 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice. Return [total_jumbo, total_small] so that the number of remaining tomatoSlices equal to 0 and the number of remaining cheeseSlices equal to 0. If it is not possible to make the remaining tomatoSlices and cheeseSlices equal to 0 return []. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,6] Explantion:</h4> To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese. There will be no remaining ingredients. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] Explantion:</h4> There will be no way to use all ingredients to make small and jumbo burgers. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> tomatoSlices = 4, cheeseSlices = 17 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] Explantion:</h4> Making 1 jumbo burger there will be 16 cheese remaining and making 2 small burgers there will be 15 cheese remaining. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices <= 107
