Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:</h4> Suppose this list is answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers. Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,2,3] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,3,2] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers:</h4> 1 and 2. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= k < n <= 104
