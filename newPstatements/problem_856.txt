You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed). We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit). For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5. Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [0,1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [true,false,false] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10. Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [false,false,false] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 105 nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
