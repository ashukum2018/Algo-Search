A chef has collected data on the satisfaction level of his n dishes. Chef can cook any dish in 1 unit of time. Like-time coefficient of a dish is defined as the time taken to cook that dish including previous dishes multiplied by its satisfaction level i.e. time[i] * satisfaction[i]. Return the maximum sum of like-time coefficient that the chef can obtain after dishes preparation. Dishes can be prepared in any order and the chef can discard some dishes to get this maximum value. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 14 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum total like-time coefficient will be equal to (-1*1 + 0*2 + 5*3 = 14). Each dish is prepared in one unit of time. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> satisfaction = [4,3,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 20 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Dishes can be prepared in any order, (2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 = 20) <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> People do not like the dishes. No dish is prepared. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == satisfaction.length 1 <= n <= 500 -1000 <= satisfaction[i] <= 1000
