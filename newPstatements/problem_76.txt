Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively. You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,0,1,1,2,2] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,0,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,1,2] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == nums.length 1 <= n <= 300 nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2. Follow up:</h4> Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
