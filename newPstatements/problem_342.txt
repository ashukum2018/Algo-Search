An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences. Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums:</h4> [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 5000 -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
