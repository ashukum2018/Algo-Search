You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors:</h4> Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color). Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 12 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 5000 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 30228214 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == grid.length 1 <= n <= 5000
