You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 49 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> height = [1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == height.length 2 <= n <= 105 0 <= height[i] <= 104
