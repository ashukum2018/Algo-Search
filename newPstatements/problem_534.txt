Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences. Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,3,5,4,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,2,2,2,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 2000 -106 <= nums[i] <= 106
