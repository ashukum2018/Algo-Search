You are given an array of strings words and a string chars. A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 10 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= words.length <= 1000 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100 words[i] and chars consist of lowercase English letters.
