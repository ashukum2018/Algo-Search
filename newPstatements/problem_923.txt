We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee. A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8. A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days. Return the length of the longest well-performing interval. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> hours = [6,6,6] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= hours.length <= 104 0 <= hours[i] <= 16
