Given an integer n, return a list of all possible full binary trees with n nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have Node.val == 0. Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in any order. A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 7 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[0,0,0]] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 20
