Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure. Clarification:</h4> The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,2,3,null,null,4,5] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
