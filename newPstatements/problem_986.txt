You are given a string s of length n containing only four kinds of characters:</h4> \'Q\', \'W\', \'E\', and \'R\'. A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n / 4 times where n is the length of the string. Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make s balanced. If s is already balanced, return 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "QWER" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> s is already balanced. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "QQWE" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We need to replace a \'Q\' to \'R\', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "QQQW" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == s.length 4 <= n <= 105 n is a multiple of 4. s contains only \'Q\', \'W\', \'E\', and \'R\'.
