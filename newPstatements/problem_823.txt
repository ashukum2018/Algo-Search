Given two integers a and b, return any string s such that:</h4> s has length a + b and contains exactly a \'a\' letters, and exactly b \'b\' letters, The substring \'aaa\' does not occur in s, and The substring \'bbb\' does not occur in s. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = 1, b = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "abb" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = 4, b = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "aabaa" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= a, b <= 100 It is guaranteed such an s exists for the given a and b.
