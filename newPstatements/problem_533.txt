There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:</h4> Button 1:</h4> Flips the status of all the bulbs. Button 2:</h4> Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...). Button 3:</h4> Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...). Button 4:</h4> Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...). You must make exactly presses button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press. Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses after performing all presses button presses. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1, presses = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Status can be:</h4> - [off] by pressing button 1 - [on] by pressing button 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, presses = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Status can be:</h4> - [off, off] by pressing button 1 - [on, off] by pressing button 2 - [off, on] by pressing button 3 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, presses = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Status can be:</h4> - [off, off, off] by pressing button 1 - [off, on, off] by pressing button 2 - [on, off, on] by pressing button 3 - [off, on, on] by pressing button 4 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000 0 <= presses <= 1000
