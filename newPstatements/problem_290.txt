Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = ["h","e","l","l","o"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["o","l","l","e","h"] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["h","a","n","n","a","H"] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 s[i] is a printable ascii character.
