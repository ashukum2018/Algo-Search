Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target. The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3], target = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The possible combination ways are:</h4> (1, 1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2) (1, 2, 1) (1, 3) (2, 1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 1) Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [9], target = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 200 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000 All the elements of nums are unique. 1 <= target <= 1000 Follow up:</h4> What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
