You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:</h4> If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape. If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total. Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "leet2code3", k = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "o" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode". The 10th letter in the string is "o". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ha22", k = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "h" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The decoded string is "hahahaha". The 5th letter is "h". <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> "a" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times. The 1st letter is "a". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= s.length <= 100 s consists of lowercase English letters and digits 2 through 9. s starts with a letter. 1 <= k <= 109 It is guaranteed that k is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string. The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 263 letters.
