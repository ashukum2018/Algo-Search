A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page\xe2\x80\x99s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:</h4> The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible. Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> area = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,2] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> area = 37 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [37,1] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> area = 122122 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [427,286] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= area <= 107
