In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let\'s call this word successor. For example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another". Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length. Return the sentence after the replacement. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "the cat was rat by the bat" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "a a b c" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100 dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters. 1 <= sentence.length <= 106 sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces. The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000] The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000] Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space. sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.
