Implement strStr(). Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack. Clarification:</h4> What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview. For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C\'s strstr() and Java\'s indexOf(). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> haystack = "hello", needle = "ll" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba" <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104 haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
