An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square. Given an integer array nums, return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful. Two permutations perm1 and perm2 are different if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i]. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,17,8] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,2,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 12 0 <= nums[i] <= 109
