Given a string s, consider all duplicated substrings:</h4> (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap. Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If s does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "". <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "banana" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "ana" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcd" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= s.length <= 3 * 104 s consists of lowercase English letters.
