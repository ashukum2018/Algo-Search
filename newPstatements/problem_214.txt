Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0\'s and 1\'s, find the largest square containing only 1\'s and return its area. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["0"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == matrix.length n == matrix[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 300 matrix[i][j] is \'0\' or \'1\'.
