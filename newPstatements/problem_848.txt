You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds. Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> time = [30,20,150,100,40] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:</h4> (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150):</h4> total duration 180 (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100):</h4> total duration 120 (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40):</h4> total duration 60 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> time = [60,60,60] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104 1 <= time[i] <= 500
