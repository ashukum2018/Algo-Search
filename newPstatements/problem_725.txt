We want to split a group of n people (labeled from 1 to n) into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. Given the integer n and the array dislikes where dislikes[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that the person labeled ai does not like the person labeled bi, return true if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> group1 [1,4] and group2 [2,3]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 2000 0 <= dislikes.length <= 104 dislikes[i].length == 2 1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= n ai < bi All the pairs of dislikes are unique.
