Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring under the following rules:</h4> The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to maxLetters. The substring size must be between minSize and maxSize inclusive. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string. It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 1 <= maxLetters <= 26 1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length) s consists of only lowercase English letters.
