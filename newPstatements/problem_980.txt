A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times. Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7. Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 34 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible combinations. In this case, looking at rollMax array, the numbers 1 and 2 appear at most once consecutively, therefore sequences (1,1) and (2,2) cannot occur, so the final answer is 36-2 = 34. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,1,1,1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 30 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, rollMax = [1,1,1,2,2,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 181 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 5000 rollMax.length == 6 1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15
