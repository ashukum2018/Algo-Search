There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai. For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1. Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= numCourses <= 2000 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000 prerequisites[i].length == 2 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
