Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num = 38 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The process is 38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11 11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 Since 2 has only one digit, return it. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num = 0 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= num <= 231 - 1 Follow up:</h4> Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
