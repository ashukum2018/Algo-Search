Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum width of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation. It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7). <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,3,2,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100
