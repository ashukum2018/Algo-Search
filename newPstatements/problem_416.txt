Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums. The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,-1,2] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The first 1's next greater number is 2; The number 2 can't find next greater number. The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,3,4,-1,4] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 104 -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
