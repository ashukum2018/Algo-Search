In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge. If the town judge exists, then:</h4> The town judge trusts nobody. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2. You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, trust = [[1,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000 0 <= trust.length <= 104 trust[i].length == 2 All the pairs of trust are unique. ai != bi 1 <= ai, bi <= n
