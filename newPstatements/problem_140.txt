Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple". Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 300 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20 s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters. All the strings of wordDict are unique.
