A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:</h4> Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList. sk == endWord Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10 endWord.length == beginWord.length 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000 wordList[i].length == beginWord.length beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters. beginWord != endWord All the words in wordList are unique.
