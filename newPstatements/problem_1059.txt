You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i). You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day. You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i]. Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6. Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1. The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000 1 <= d <= 10
