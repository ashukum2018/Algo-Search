You are given an m x n grid. Each cell of grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:</h4> 1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell. 2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell. 3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell. 4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell. 5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell. 6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell. You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow the streets. Notice that you are not allowed to change any street. Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0) <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,1,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 300 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6
