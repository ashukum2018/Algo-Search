You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> prices = [7,6,4,3,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= prices.length <= 105 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
