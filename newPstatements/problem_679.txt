A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum. Given a row x col grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 "magic square" subgrids are there? (Each subgrid is contiguous). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:</h4> while this one is not:</h4> In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[8]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> row == grid.length col == grid[i].length 1 <= row, col <= 10 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15
