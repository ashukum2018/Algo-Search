You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators [\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'] and the parentheses \'(\' and \')\' to get the value 24. You are restricted with the following rules:</h4> The division operator \'/\' represents real division, not integer division. \t For example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12. Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use \'-\' as a unary operator. \t For example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression "-1 - 1 - 1 - 1" is not allowed. You cannot concatenate numbers together \t For example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression "12 + 12" is not valid. Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> cards = [4,1,8,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> (8-4) * (7-1) = 24 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> cards = [1,2,1,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> cards.length == 4 1 <= cards[i] <= 9
