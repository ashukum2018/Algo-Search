An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 12 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1690
