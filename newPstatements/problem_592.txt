You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= k <= n <= 100 1 <= times.length <= 6000 times[i].length == 3 1 <= ui, vi <= n ui != vi 0 <= wi <= 100 All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
