A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array. Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "1000", k = 10000 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only possible array is [1000] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "1000", k = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "1317", k = 2000 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 8 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros. 1 <= k <= 109
