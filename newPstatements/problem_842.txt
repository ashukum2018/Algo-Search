Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 10 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 105 nums[i] is either 0 or 1. 0 <= k <= nums.length
