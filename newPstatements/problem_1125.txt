Return the text after replacing the entities by the special characters. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> text = "&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not." <br><h4>Output:</h4> "& is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not." <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The parser will replace the &amp; entity by & <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> text = "and I quote:</h4> &quot;...&quot;" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "and I quote:</h4> \\"...\\"" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= text.length <= 105 The string may contain any possible characters out of all the 256 ASCII characters.
