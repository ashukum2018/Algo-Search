Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product. The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,3,-2,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [2,3] has the largest product 6. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [-2,0,-1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104 -10 <= nums[i] <= 10 The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
