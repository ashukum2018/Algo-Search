Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:</h4> perm[i] is divisible by i. i is divisible by perm[i]. Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:</h4> - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1 - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2 The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:</h4> - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1 - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 15
