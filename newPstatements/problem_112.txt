Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. Note:</h4> A leaf is a node with no children. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105]. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
