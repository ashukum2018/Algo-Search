You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length 1 <= n <= 20 -1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000
