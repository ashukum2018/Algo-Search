You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee. Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. Note:</h4> You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 8 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The maximum profit can be achieved by:</h4> - Buying at prices[0] = 1 - Selling at prices[3] = 8 - Buying at prices[4] = 4 - Selling at prices[5] = 9 The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104 0 <= fee < 5 * 104
