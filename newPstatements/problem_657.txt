Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions \'A\' (accelerate) and \'R\' (reverse):</h4> When you get an instruction \'A\', your car does the following:</h4> \t position += speed speed *= 2 When you get an instruction \'R\', your car does the following:</h4> \t If your speed is positive then speed = -1 otherwise speed = 1 \tYour position stays the same. For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1. Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> target = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The shortest instruction sequence is "AA". Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> target = 6 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA". Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= target <= 104
