Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= intervals.length <= 105 intervals[i].length == 2 -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
