You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters). Return the number of boomerangs. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[1,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == points.length 1 <= n <= 500 points[i].length == 2 -104 <= xi, yi <= 104 All the points are unique.
