You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle. Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner. The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above. There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:</h4> 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == obstacleGrid.length n == obstacleGrid[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 100 obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
