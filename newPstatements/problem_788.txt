Given an array arr of 4 digits, find the latest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once. 24-hour times are formatted as "HH:</h4>MM", where HH is between 00 and 23, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 24-hour time is 00:</h4>00, and the latest is 23:</h4>59. Return the latest 24-hour time in "HH:</h4>MM" format. If no valid time can be made, return an empty string. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr = [1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> "23:</h4>41" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The valid 24-hour times are "12:</h4>34", "12:</h4>43", "13:</h4>24", "13:</h4>42", "14:</h4>23", "14:</h4>32", "21:</h4>34", "21:</h4>43", "23:</h4>14", and "23:</h4>41". Of these times, "23:</h4>41" is the latest. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr = [5,5,5,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> "" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are no valid 24-hour times as "55:</h4>55" is not valid. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> arr.length == 4 0 <= arr[i] <= 9
