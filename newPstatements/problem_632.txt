Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s. A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde". <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s:</h4> "a", "acd", "ace". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 1 <= words.length <= 5000 1 <= words[i].length <= 50 s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
