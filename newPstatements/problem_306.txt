We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</h4> I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked. Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess. You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:</h4> -1:</h4> Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick). 1:</h4> Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick). 0:</h4> your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick). Return the number that I picked. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 10, pick = 6 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1, pick = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, pick = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 231 - 1 1 <= pick <= n
