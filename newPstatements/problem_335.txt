Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves. A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 24 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
