Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings. Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["i","love"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words. Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["the","is","sunny","day"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= words.length <= 500 1 <= words[i] <= 10 words[i] consists of lowercase English letters. k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]] Follow-up:</h4> Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?
