You are given a string text. You can swap two of the characters in the text. Return the length of the longest substring with repeated characters. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> text = "ababa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We can swap the first \'b\' with the last \'a\', or the last \'b\' with the first \'a\'. Then, the longest repeated character substring is "aaa" with length 3. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> text = "aaabaaa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Swap \'b\' with the last \'a\' (or the first \'a\'), and we get longest repeated character substring "aaaaaa" with length 6. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> text = "aaaaa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is "aaaaa" with length is 5. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= text.length <= 2 * 104 text consist of lowercase English characters only.
