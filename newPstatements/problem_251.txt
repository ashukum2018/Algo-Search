Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number. You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,3,4,2,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [3,1,3,4,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 105 nums.length == n + 1 1 <= nums[i] <= n All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times. Follow up:</h4> How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
