Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST. For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [-10,-3,0,5,9] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,-3,9,-10,null,5] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 104]. -105 <= Node.val <= 105
