Return the number of permutations of 1 to n so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.) (Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.) Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 12 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 100 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 682289015 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 100
