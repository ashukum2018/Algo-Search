Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s. Return the number of closed islands. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], [1,0,0,0,0,0,1], [1,0,1,1,1,0,1], [1,0,1,0,1,0,1], [1,0,1,1,1,0,1], [1,0,0,0,0,0,1], [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100 0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
