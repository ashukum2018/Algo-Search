Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,5]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= intervals.length <= 104 intervals[i].length == 2 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
