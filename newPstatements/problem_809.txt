Given three integers x, y, and bound, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to bound. An integer is powerful if it can be represented as xi + yj for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0. You may return the answer in any order. In your answer, each value should occur at most once. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,3,4,5,7,9,10] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 2 = 20 + 30 3 = 21 + 30 4 = 20 + 31 5 = 21 + 31 7 = 22 + 31 9 = 23 + 30 10 = 20 + 32 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,4,6,8,10,14] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= x, y <= 100 0 <= bound <= 106
