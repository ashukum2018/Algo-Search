Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string. Note:</h4> You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num1 = "2", num2 = "3" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "6" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> num1 = "123", num2 = "456" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "56088" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200 num1 and num2 consist of digits only. Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
