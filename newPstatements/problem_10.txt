Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> x = 121 <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> x = -121 <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> x = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> -231 <= x <= 231 - 1 Follow up:</h4> Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
