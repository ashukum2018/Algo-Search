Given an array nums of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [3,6,5,1,8] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 18 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3). <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 12 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
