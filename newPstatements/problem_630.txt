You have two types of tiles:</h4> a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes. Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The five different ways are show above. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000
