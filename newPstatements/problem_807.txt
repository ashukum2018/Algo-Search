You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children. Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [0,0,null,0,0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000]. Node.val == 0
