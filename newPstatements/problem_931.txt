Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn't exist in the grid. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 9 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,1,0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= grid.length <= 100 1 <= grid[0].length <= 100 grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
