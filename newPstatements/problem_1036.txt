You are given a string s formed by digits and \'#\'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:</h4> Characters (\'a\' to \'i\') are represented by (\'1\' to \'9\') respectively. Characters (\'j\' to \'z\') are represented by (\'10#\' to \'26#\') respectively. Return the string formed after mapping. The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "10#11#12" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "jkab" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "1326#" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "acz" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s consists of digits and the \'#\' letter. s will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.
