Let\'s say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome, and it is also the square of a palindrome. Given two positive integers left and right represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range [left, right]. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> left = "4", right = "1000" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 4, 9, 121, and 484 are superpalindromes. Note that 676 is not a superpalindrome:</h4> 26 * 26 = 676, but 26 is not a palindrome. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> left = "1", right = "2" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= left.length, right.length <= 18 left and right consist of only digits. left and right cannot have leading zeros. left and right represent integers in the range [1, 1018 - 1]. left is less than or equal to right.
