For an integer array nums, an inverse pair is a pair of integers [i, j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and nums[i] > nums[j]. Given two integers n and k, return the number of different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs. Since the answer can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, k = 0 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pairs. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 1000 0 <= k <= 1000
