Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string. Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "tree" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "eert" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> \'e\' appears twice while \'r\' and \'t\' both appear once. So \'e\' must appear before both \'r\' and \'t\'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "cccaaa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "aaaccc" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Both \'c\' and \'a\' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers. Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "Aabb" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "bbAa" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect. Note that \'A\' and \'a\' are treated as two different characters. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105 s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.
