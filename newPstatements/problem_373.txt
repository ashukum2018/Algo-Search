There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons. Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path. Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:</h4> - Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]. - Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:</h4> - Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3]. - Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5]. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= points.length <= 105 points[i].length == 2 -231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1
