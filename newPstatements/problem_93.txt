Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,4,3,2,5] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [5], left = 1, right = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [5] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the list is n. 1 <= n <= 500 -500 <= Node.val <= 500 1 <= left <= right <= n Follow up:</h4> Could you do it in one pass?
