You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order. Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:</h4> Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer). All subsequences have a length of 3 or more. Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise. A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> nums can be split into the following subsequences:</h4> [1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3 [1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> nums can be split into the following subsequences:</h4> [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 104 -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000 nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
