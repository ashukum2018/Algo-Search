Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21". Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities. Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points. Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1.00000 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Alice gets a single card, then stops. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0.60000 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Alice gets a single card, then stops. In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0.73278 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= k <= n <= 104 1 <= maxPts <= 104
