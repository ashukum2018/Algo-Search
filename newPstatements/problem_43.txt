Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> height = [4,2,0,3,2,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 9 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == height.length 1 <= n <= 2 * 104 0 <= height[i] <= 105
