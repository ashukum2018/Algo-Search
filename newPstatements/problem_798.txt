An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a \'/\', \'\\\', or blank space \' \'. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions. Given the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions. Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \'\\\' is represented as \'\\\\\'. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [" /","/ "] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [" /"," "] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = ["/\\\\","\\\\/"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Recall that because \\ characters are escaped, "\\\\/" refers to \\/, and "/\\\\" refers to /\\. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == grid.length == grid[i].length 1 <= n <= 30 grid[i][j] is either \'/\', \'\\\', or \' \'.
