Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = "11", b = "1" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "100" <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> a = "1010", b = "1011" <br><h4>Output:</h4> "10101" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104 a and b consist only of \'0\' or \'1\' characters. Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
