No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation. Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [A, B] where:</h4> A and B are No-Zero integers. A + B = n The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,1] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 11 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,9] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= n <= 104
