Given an integer array nums, return the number of all the arithmetic subsequences of nums. A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], [7, 7, 7, 7], and [3, -1, -5, -9] are arithmetic sequences. For example, [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not an arithmetic sequence. A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array. For example, [2,5,10] is a subsequence of [1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]. The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in 32-bit integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [2,4,6,8,10] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> All arithmetic subsequence slices are:</h4> [2,4,6] [4,6,8] [6,8,10] [2,4,6,8] [4,6,8,10] [2,4,6,8,10] [2,6,10] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [7,7,7,7,7] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 16 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
