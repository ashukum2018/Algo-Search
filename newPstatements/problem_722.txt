You are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes. Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j). We view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes. A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side. Return the total area of all three projections. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,2],[3,4]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 17 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> grid = [[1,0],[0,2]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 8 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == grid.length == grid[i].length 1 <= n <= 50 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50
