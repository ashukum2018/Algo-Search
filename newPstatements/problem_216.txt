Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles. The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2). The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 45 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 16 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> -104 <= ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2, bx1, by1, bx2, by2 <= 104
