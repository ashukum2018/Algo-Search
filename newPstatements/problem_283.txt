You are given an array of integers distance. You start at point (0,0) on an X-Y plane and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise. Return true if your path crosses itself, and false if it does not. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> distance = [2,1,1,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> distance = [1,2,3,4] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> distance = [1,1,1,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= distance.length <= 105 1 <= distance[i] <= 105
