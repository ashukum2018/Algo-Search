Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:</h4> Only numbers 1 through 9 are used. Each number is used at most once. Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 3, n = 7 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,2,4]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 There are no other valid combinations. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 3, n = 9 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 There are no other valid combinations. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 4, n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are no valid combinations. Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= k <= 9 1 <= n <= 60
