Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :</h4> p[0] = start p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation. p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2, start = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [3,2,0,1] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, start = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 16 0 <= start < 2 ^ n
