Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree. A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0,-3,9,-10,null,5] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:</h4> <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [3,1] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= nums.length <= 104 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104 nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
