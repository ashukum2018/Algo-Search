Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string. The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:</h4> "()" has score 1. AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings. (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "()" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "(())" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "()()" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 2 <= s.length <= 50 s consists of only \'(\' and \')\'. s is a balanced parentheses string.
