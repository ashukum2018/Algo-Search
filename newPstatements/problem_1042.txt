Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0. A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 18 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. 1 <= Node.val <= 100
