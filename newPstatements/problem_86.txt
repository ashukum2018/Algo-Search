Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0\'s and 1\'s, find the largest rectangle containing only 1\'s and return its area. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["0"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [["1"]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> rows == matrix.length cols == matrix[i].length 1 <= row, cols <= 200 matrix[i][j] is \'0\' or \'1\'.
