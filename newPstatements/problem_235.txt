Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "anagram", t = "nagaram" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "rat", t = "car" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104 s and t consist of lowercase English letters. Follow up:</h4> What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
