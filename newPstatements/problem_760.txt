A parentheses string is valid if and only if:</h4> It is the empty string, It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string. You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string. For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))". Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "())" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "(((" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s[i] is either \'(\' or \')\'.
