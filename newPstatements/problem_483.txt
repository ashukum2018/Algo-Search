Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings. You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["Shogun"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["Shogun"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1). <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000 1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30 list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces \' \' and English letters. All the stings of list1 are unique. All the stings of list2 are unique.
