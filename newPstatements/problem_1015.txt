Given a m x n binary matrix mat. In one step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing 1 to 0 and 0 to 1). A pair of cells are called neighbors if they share one edge. Return the minimum number of steps required to convert mat to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot. A binary matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0 or 1 only. A zero matrix is a matrix with all cells equal to 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> mat = [[0,0],[0,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> mat = [[0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Given matrix is a zero matrix. We do not need to change it. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> mat = [[1,0,0],[1,0,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Given matrix cannot be a zero matrix. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> m == mat.length n == mat[i].length 1 <= m, n <= 3 mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
