Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aaabb", k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The longest substring is "aaa", as \'a\' is repeated 3 times. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ababbc", k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The longest substring is "ababb", as \'a\' is repeated 2 times and \'b\' is repeated 3 times. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 104 s consists of only lowercase English letters. 1 <= k <= 105
