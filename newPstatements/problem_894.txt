Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together. Each number is given in array format:</h4> as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit. For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3. A number arr in array, format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros:</h4> either arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1. Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format:</h4> as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,0,0,0,0] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr1 = [0], arr2 = [0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [0] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> arr1 = [0], arr2 = [1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000 arr1[i] and arr2[i] are 0 or 1 arr1 and arr2 have no leading zeros
