A magical string s consists of only \'1\' and \'2\' and obeys the following rules:</h4> The string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters \'1\' and \'2\' generates the string s itself. The first few elements of s is s = "1221121221221121122\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6". If we group the consecutive 1\'s and 2\'s in s, it will be "1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......" and the occurrences of 1\'s or 2\'s in each group are "1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself. Given an integer n, return the number of 1\'s in the first n number in the magical string s. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 6 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The first 6 elements of magical string s is "122112" and it contains three 1\'s, so return 3. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 105
