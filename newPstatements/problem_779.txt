Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abc" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc". <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aba" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba". <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "aaa" <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 2000 s consists of lowercase English letters.
