There are n people and 40 types of hats labeled from 1 to 40. Given a 2D integer array hats, where hats[i] is a list of all hats preferred by the ith person. Return the number of ways that the n people wear different hats to each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> hats = [[3,4],[4,5],[5]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There is only one way to choose hats given the conditions. First person choose hat 3, Second person choose hat 4 and last one hat 5. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> hats = [[3,5,1],[3,5]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are 4 ways to choose hats:</h4> (3,5), (5,3), (1,3) and (1,5) <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> hats = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 24 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Each person can choose hats labeled from 1 to 4. Number of Permutations of (1,2,3,4) = 24. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> n == hats.length 1 <= n <= 10 1 <= hats[i].length <= 40 1 <= hats[i][j] <= 40 hats[i] contains a list of unique integers.
