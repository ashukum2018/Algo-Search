Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1. Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1. Note:</h4> n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> -1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= k <= 105
