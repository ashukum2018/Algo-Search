In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character. For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy". A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6]. A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters. Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abbxxxxzzy" <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[3,6]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abc" <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd" <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 1000 s contains lowercase English letters only.
