We have two special characters:</h4> The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11). Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> bits = [1,0,0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> bits = [1,1,1,0] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is not one-bit character. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= bits.length <= 1000 bits[i] is either 0 or 1.
