You are given an array target and an integer n. In each iteration, you will read a number from list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n]. Build the target array using the following operations:</h4> "Push":</h4> Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array. "Pop":</h4> Deletes the last element of the array. If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements. Return a list of the operations needed to build target. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> target = [1,3], n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1] Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1] Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> target = [1,2,3], n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["Push","Push","Push"] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> target = [1,2], n = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["Push","Push"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You only need to read the first 2 numbers and stop. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= target.length <= 100 1 <= n <= 100 1 <= target[i] <= n target is strictly increasing.
