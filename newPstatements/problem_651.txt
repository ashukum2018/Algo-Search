Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2.00000 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0.50000 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 3 <= points.length <= 50 -50 <= xi, yi <= 50 All the given points are unique.
