A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array primes. Given an integer n and an array of integers primes, return the nth super ugly number. The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 32 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1, primes = [2,3,5] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are in the array primes = [2,3,5]. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 105 1 <= primes.length <= 100 2 <= primes[i] <= 1000 primes[i] is guaranteed to be a prime number. All the values of primes are unique and sorted in ascending order.
