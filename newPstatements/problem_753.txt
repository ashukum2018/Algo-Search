In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it. Return true if and only if you can choose X >= 2 such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:</h4> Each group has exactly X cards. All the cards in each group have the same integer. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4]. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3] <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> No possible partition. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= deck.length <= 104 0 <= deck[i] < 104
