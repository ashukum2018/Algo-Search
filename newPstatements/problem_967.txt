An ugly number is a positive integer that is divisible by a, b, or c. Given four integers n, a, b, and c, return the nth ugly number. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 10 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n, a, b, c <= 109 1 <= a * b * c <= 1018 It is guaranteed that the result will be in range [1, 2 * 109].
