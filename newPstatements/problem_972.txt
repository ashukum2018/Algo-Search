You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost. You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters). Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 3 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t, so the maximum length is 1. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 1 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 t.length == s.length 0 <= maxCost <= 106 s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.
