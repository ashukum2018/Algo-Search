You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val. Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,1,3] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000]. 1 <= Node.val <= 107 root is a binary search tree. 1 <= val <= 107
