Given an integer n, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to n. You can return the answer in any order. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["1/2"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["1/2","1/3","2/3"] <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2". <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 100
