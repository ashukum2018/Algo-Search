Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements. Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,2,3,1] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 2 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice. Of the subarrays that have the same degree:</h4> [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2] The shortest length is 2. So return 2. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 6 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> The degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times. So [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000. nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.
