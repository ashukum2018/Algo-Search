Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. Recall that x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x and by convention, 0! = 1. For example, f(3) = 0 because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while f(11) = 2 because 11! = 39916800 has two zeroes at the end. Given an integer k, return the number of non-negative integers x have the property that f(x) = k. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 0 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with k = 0 zeroes. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 5 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 0 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There is no x such that x! ends in k = 5 zeroes. <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> k = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 5 <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= k <= 109
