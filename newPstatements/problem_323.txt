Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise. A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= s.length <= 100 0 <= t.length <= 104 s and t consist only of lowercase English letters. Follow up:</h4> Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
