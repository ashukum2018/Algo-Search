Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values. Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples) <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [5,6,3,2,4,1] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. 0 <= Node.val <= 104 The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000. Follow up:</h4> Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
