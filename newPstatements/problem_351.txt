You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times. Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "ABAB", k = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Replace the two \'A\'s with two \'B\'s or vice versa. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "AABABBA", k = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> 4 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> Replace the one \'A\' in the middle with \'B\' and form "AABBBBA". The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 105 s consists of only uppercase English letters. 0 <= k <= s.length
