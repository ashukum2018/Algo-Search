You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order. Return the intersection of these two interval lists. A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b. The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3]. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = [] <br><h4>Output:</h4> [] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000 firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1 0 <= starti < endi <= 109 endi < starti+1 0 <= startj < endj <= 109 endj < startj+1
