Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x. You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,2,2,4,3,5] <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> head = [2,1], x = 2 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [1,2] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100 -200 <= x <= 200
