Given an array of strings words, return the smallest string that contains each string in words as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings of the smallest length, return any of them. You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["alex","loves","leetcode"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> "alexlovesleetcode" <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> words = ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"] <br><h4>Output:</h4> "gctaagttcatgcatc" <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= words.length <= 12 1 <= words[i].length <= 20 words[i] consists of lowercase English letters. All the strings of words are unique.
