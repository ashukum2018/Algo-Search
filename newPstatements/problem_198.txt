Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "egg", t = "add" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "foo", t = "bar" <br><h4>Output:</h4> false <br><h4>Example 3:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> s = "paper", t = "title" <br><h4>Output:</h4> true <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 t.length == s.length s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
