Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [ [0,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1] ] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 15 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are 10 squares of side 1. There are 4 squares of side 2. There is 1 square of side 3. Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> matrix = [ [1,0,1], [1,1,0], [1,1,0] ] <br><h4>Output:</h4> 7 <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There are 6 squares of side 1. There is 1 square of side 2. Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7. <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= arr.length <= 300 1 <= arr[0].length <= 300 0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1
