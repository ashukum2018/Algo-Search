The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens\' placement, where \'Q\' and \'.\' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively. <br><h4>Example 1:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 4 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]] <br><h4>Explanation:</h4> There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above <br><h4>Example 2:</h4> <br><h4>Input:</h4> n = 1 <br><h4>Output:</h4> [["Q"]] <br><h4>Constraints:</h4> 1 <= n <= 9
